> As they say, a CSS with superpowers.

> You can make your stylings more readable and make things easy to understand.

> Sass, sass lang.

## FAQ

- **Why to use Sass instead of only CSS?**
  - I am able to create some parcial files to put my variables that can be used on the entire project,
    create mixings for repeatable styles and create files to reset css to the state i want to be on the entire or part of the project.
